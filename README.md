# Movie-Recommender
Recommendation systems in e-commerce become increasingly important due to the large number of choices consumers face.  In general, recommendation systems first take a set of input which could be user profiles, a set of item ratings, etc, identify similarities among the input, and pass the similar pairs for prediction calculation.  Among the techniques used in building recommendation systems, content filtering is one of the most promising approaches. In this project, we mainly address the challenges of building an efficient and useful recommendation system given a large data set, and discuss our approach on our prediction heuristics.  We also present the results of our experiment where we evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm based on the predictions calculated by trivial algorithms, and the result shows that our algorithm can give accurate ratings.
